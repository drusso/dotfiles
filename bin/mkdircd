#
# Quick shortcut to make a directory (with -p) and directly cd into it.
#
# USAGE:
#
#   $ . mkdircd foo
#
# In this example, the command creates the directory `foo` (if it doesn't
# exist) and cds into it immediately.
#
# Note that cd'ing into the directory will only work if you run it with the dot
# operator!

mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"
